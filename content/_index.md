As a seasoned Site Reliability Engineer with a passion for automation and infrastructure optimization, I bring over 10 years of experience in designing and implementing scalable, reliable systems as part of a 20+ year IT career. My expertise lies in harnessing the power
of Terraform and Ansible to automate infrastructure deployments, ensuring seamless and consistent delivery of high-quality applications. With a strong foundation in CI/CD pipelines, I've worked extensively with Jenkins and GitHub Actions to
streamline development workflows and improve deployment efficiency.

Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work across various sectors, including public education institutions and private technology companies. This diverse experience has given me a unique perspective on the challenges and opportunities
facing organizations of all sizes. As a collaborator at heart, I thrive in environments where knowledge sharing and mutual support are valued. My experience working with colleagues from both academia and industry has taught me the importance of
effective communication, adaptability, and continuous learning.

As a certified Hashicorp Terraform Associate and AWS Cloud Practitioner, I'm well-versed in the latest trends and best practices in SRE. Whether you're looking to automate tedious tasks, improve application reliability, or simply streamline your
development workflow, I'm here to help. Let's work together to build scalable, efficient systems that meet your needs and exceed your expectations.
