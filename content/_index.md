I have over 20 years experience in some form of IT role; starting out with the typical helpdesk experience, through the fields of system administration, product engineering and finally cloud engineering. I've worked in both the public and private sectors with the challenges that come with each. As well as the technology aspect of these roles I enjoy mentoring less experienced colleagues to bring out the best in them through a combination of training sessions, assisting them by giving them the right tools and mindset to solve challenging problems, and 1:1 availability to address their questions.
