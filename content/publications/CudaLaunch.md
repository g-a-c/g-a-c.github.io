This talk focused on Barracuda's new Remote Access features for the CloudGen Firewall appliances, and the replacement of legacy SSL VPN appliances. The sessions were attended by partners and customers who were present at the summit, and gave a great opportunity to get face to face with them to explain Barracuda's upcoming progress and answer any questions or fears in a relatively small, informal environment.
