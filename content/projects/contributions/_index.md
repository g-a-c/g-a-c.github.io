This page represents the landing page for "contributions" section. It is also shown under the homepage header for "contributions". It should be therefore relatively short and sweet.

A collection of items which I contributed, but did not originally create. Contributing back to Open Source projects is an interest of mine; I enjoy the technical challenges (both in performing root cause analysis, and if I can, contributing a fix myself), and I find it satisfying raising detailed bug tickets for issues which _I've_ experienced knowing that I might also be saving someone else time in future.
