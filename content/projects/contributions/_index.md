This page represents the landing page for "contributions" section. It is also shown under the homepage header for "contributions". It should be therefore relatively short and sweet.

A collection of items which I contributed, but did not originally create. Contributing back to Open Source projects is an interest of mine; I enjoy the technical challenges (both in performing root cause analysis, and if I can, contributing a fix myself), and I find it satisfying raising detailed bug tickets for issues which _I've_ experienced knowing that I might also be saving someone else time in future.

As well as the contributions that get their own pages, there are more trivial fixes that I've made, generally as either documentation fixes or obvious code fixes which did not require root cause analysis.
